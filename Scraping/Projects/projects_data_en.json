Yet migration systems in both countries are complicated and time-consuming, and attempting to formalize one’s migratory status does not guarantee a favorable outcome by any means. For this reason, many people choose to –or, rather, <strong>have no choice but to–</strong> migrate irregularly, even though this may expose them to human and drug traffickers, labor abuse, corrupt authorities, detention, deportation, and many other perils.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<h4></h4>\n<h4><span><strong>How to assist people who choose to relocate in search of better living conditions?</strong></span></h4>\n<p>\n</p>",

But in some other instances, support from the local community has not come easy because there have been some complaints about the behavior of some of the migrants. The shelter has tried to redress the situation with different strategies. In 2019, for instance, the shelter aided <strong>the Federal Government</strong> in drafting the Social Emergency Program of the Welfare Bureau. Thanks to this agreement, migrants waiting for papers are now given <strong>monthly economic aid in exchange for work that benefits the shelter and the local community</strong> (fixing the streets, cleaning the train tracks, etc.). In this way migrants may get a small salary that <strong>allows them to cope with the waiting time</strong> and people in the community have <strong>more incentives</strong> to welcome and support the shelter’s project.

And the project has also worked on <strong>building solidarity</strong> with the cause within the <strong>Catholic Church</strong> (to which the shelter’s team belongs) and amongst <strong>society</strong> at large. As part of these efforts to raise awareness of the problem and advocate for the rights of migrants, the Brothers on the Road shelter <strong>has engaged in activism, collaborated with documentary filmmakers</strong> <strong>to shed light on the issue</strong> and on its own work, and established <strong>agreements and collaborations</strong> with the government (with programs such as the Welfare Bureau’s, for instance) and with other organizations (such as REDODEM).</p>\n<p> </p>"

How it works is <strong>Nochlezhka's social workers</strong> pick suitable candidates, and Hilton Hotels <strong>offers them a scholarship</strong> to study a career in tourism, as well as <strong>temporary employment </strong>once they complete their studies. The beneficiaries of this initiative will therefore get both an education and relevant work experience by the time they finish. If the <strong>pilot</strong> works, the plan is to <strong>expand</strong> it by creating other similar opportunities with different partnerships. And much like the University of Tourism, other people also support the project with <strong>courses that they impart for free (pro bono)</strong>, but Nochlezhka also pays <strong>for some extra courses </strong>(such as industrial mountaineering!) through different institutions to <strong>further expand</strong> the possibilities of the people it aids.</p>\n<p> </p>"

        "introduction": "<h6>info 2022</h6>\n<p>Over the last few decades, cities have grown a lot. In 1950, 30% of the world’s population lived in urban areas and today <a href=\"https://population.un.org/wup/publications/files/wup2014-highlights.pdf\">that figure is more than 50%</a>. Moreover, city life has changed our consumption habits so much that today we produce <a href=\"https://globalcenters.columbia.edu/sites/default/files/content/santiago/PUBLICATIONS/ThanosBourtsalasPPT.pdf\">3 times more waste</a> than we did back then!</p>\n<p>What to do with so much waste? Evidently, we <strong>need to learn to produce less and to better manage the waste we generate</strong> because, although many innovations have been made to manage and reuse it, the change has been so fast and radical that at present <strong>we don’t have the capacity </strong>to achieve it effectively, and we are generating an <strong>enormous amount of pollution and affecting our health and that of the entire planet</strong>. Garbage in the streets produces bad odors and unpleasant environments. It pollutes the air and clogs the sewage. Garbage dumps pollute land and water sources and also generate methane gas, which is contributing to <strong>climate change.</strong></p>\n<p>In<a href=\"https://documents1.worldbank.org/curated/en/983771527663689822/pdf/Indonesia-Marine-debris-hotspot-rapid-assessment-synthesis-report.pdf\"><strong> Indonesia</strong></a>, where <strong>an extra 6,500 tons of garbage is produced every year,</strong> the government has failed to establish an appropriately efficient system to manage it, despite many efforts to achieve it. Much of the garbage generated in people’s homes is not collected and <strong>landfills are constantly overloaded.</strong> Moreover, <strong>only less than 20% </strong>of waste<strong> is being recycled</strong>, and although <strong>there are centers that buy waste for recycling,</strong> they usually only buy <strong>a few types of waste</strong> (such as plastic and glass). To make matters worse, as in the rest of the world, either due to<strong> lack of disposal alternatives </strong>or <strong>awareness</strong> regarding the seriousness of the situation, many people maintain <a href=\"http://kotaku.pu.go.id/view/9467/berguru-olah-sampah-ala-kota-gudeg\">habits that do not contribute to solving the problem</a> such as indiscriminate burning of waste, throwing it in the wrong places or not sorting it. And the efforts of the few people who sort their garbage are squandered when the public collection services, by not having an effective management system, <a href=\"https://www.ashoka.org/en-us/fellow/bambang-suwerda\">mix it again</a> with the rest of the waste they collect.</p>\n<p>This has long been the case at the Piyungan <strong>landfill for final waste disposal  </strong>(<a href=\"https://greeneration.org/media/green-info/tempat-pengelolaan-sampah-di-indonesia-terancam-penuh-apa-yang-bisa-kita-lakukan/?gclid=Cj0KCQjwvLOTBhCJARIsACVldV3nl7t4KAMoEbinSAwz0Y86krQGZ67gO_LEADs_wKsDSzHEKNMpByAaAnWHEALw_wcB\">TPA</a>), which is usually the landfill that receives garbage from Bantul and other localities of the Indonesian province of<strong> Yogyakarta. </strong>The landfill is constantly<strong> overloaded with waste </strong>and has to close seasonally, which leaves local garbage collectors without alternatives for channeling waste, and thus stops garbage collection from households and public places.</p>\n<p>With the <strong>Yogyakarta earthquake in 2006</strong>, the situation <a href=\"http://www.ampl.or.id/digilib/read/recycling-waste-creates-jobs-income/31991\">worsened</a> because the dumpsters were ruined, people had to buy a lot of temporary utensils because their things had been destroyed and, with so much new waste, the collection system collapsed, causing <a href=\"https://teragan.info/mengelola-sampah-di-gemah-ripah-yogyakarta\">garbage to accumulate in the houses and on the streets</a> and <strong>many people started worrying about this problem. </strong></p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<h4><span><strong>How to reduce, make the most of and better manage waste?</strong></span></h4>\n<p>\n</p>",

So much so that it now occupies an area of ocean measuring some <a href=\"https://www.nationalgeographic.es/viaje-y-aventuras/2021/08/las-algas-amenazan-las-paradisiacas-playas-de-cancun-podra-la-ciencia-ayudar-a-solucionar-el-problema\">9,000 kilometers in length</a> and each year, in the spring and summer seasons, it drifts in large quantities towards the coasts of the Mexican Caribbean.</p>\n<p>Stagnant on the beaches, sargassum prevents coral reefs from getting the sunlight they need to survive, spoils the landscape, prevents people from swimming in the sea, and when it decomposes, releases toxic chemicals that harm animals and give off foul odors. In addition to the enormous environmental impact, all this has scared away many visitors and has <strong>dealt a heavy blow to the local economy which is heavily dependent on tourism</strong> (which yields <a href=\"https://www.nationalgeographic.es/viaje-y-aventuras/2021/08/las-algas-amenazan-las-paradisiacas-playas-de-cancun-podra-la-ciencia-ayudar-a-solucionar-el-problema\">more than 85% of its GDP!</a>).</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<h4><span><strong>How to reduce the environmental and economic impact of sargassum?</strong></span></h4>\n<p>\n</p>",

Then there are the costs of shipping the seaweed, financing a warehouse to store it (<strong>so that it lasts</strong> for the off-season), and cleaning and processing it to yield the extract. Because of all this, the company decided that its soaps would be <strong>aimed at a middle-class consumer profile</strong> in order to sell at a price that made the investment profitable.

A battle in which, by the way,<strong> the communities that have inhabited and preserved them for hundreds of years are rarely taken into account, which disregards their right to make decisions about how to manage them.</strong></p>\n<p>The same thing is happening in the region of<strong> West Kalimantan, </strong>in the Indonesian part of Borneo island, where since the 1960’s,<strong> the State has used communities’ territories to carry out its projects (or to hand them over to private capitals) </strong>using as an excuse that the <a href=\"https://emerhub.com/files/1960_Agrarian_Law_INDOSIGHT.pdf\">national interest</a> is more important, to the point of<a href=\"https://www.elaw.org/es/content/indonesia-number-41-1999-stipulation-act-forestry\"><strong> modifying the law</strong></a> to<strong> define their forests </strong>(the <strong>“customary forests”) as part of the “<a href=\"https://smujo.id/biodiv/article/view/9928\">State forests</a>”</strong>.</p>\n<p>Since the early 1970s, <strong>the communities of the Dayak Iban ethnic group</strong> have seen the appearance of more and more companies and civil organizations, national and foreign, interested in their territories. Some trying to launch projects to <strong>exploit them,</strong> by cutting down trees or establishing mining and palm oil plantations, and others trying to <a href=\"https://www.jstor.org/stable/resrep02368.8#metadata_info_tab_contents\"><strong>protect them</strong></a> by designating conservation areas and national parks (because by 2010, <a href=\"https://www.equatorinitiative.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Sungai-Utik-Case-Study-English-FNL.pdf\"><strong>more than 10 million hectares had already been lost!</strong></a>).</p>\n<p>With <strong>few legal tools to defend their territories and many economic needs to sort out,</strong> several communities have had to <strong>adjust to the new laws</strong> that tell them how to manage <strong>their own lands</strong> in order to conserve them or, in other cases, they have decided to <strong>sell them,</strong> or to allow companies to cut down their trees in order to obtain revenue to survive. However, other communities <strong>have not felt comfortable with either option</strong>. On one hand, they are concerned that the new conservation laws will limit their ability to manage and preserve them as they have done until now, according to their traditional way of life. And, on the other hand, they are worried about making agreements with companies that could quickly run down their resources and end up dispossessing them of their territories.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<h4><span><strong>How to take advantage of our forests without destroying them and without putting our way of life and our autonomy at risk?</strong></span></h4>\n<p>\n</p>",

Also, its community is one of the few that still <strong>preserves the traditional way of life of the Dayak Iban</strong>.

Many, for example, <strong>obtain an extra income selling handicrafts</strong> that are normally used for <strong>self-consumption</strong>, such as textiles, baskets or wicker rugs, and others accommodate visitors in their homes. In this case, they are <strong>required</strong> to pay a <strong>small percentage</strong> of the profits to integrate them into a savings account that is used as an <strong>emergency fund</strong> for the community. For now, Sungai Utik is<strong> piloting</strong> this alternative with <strong>controlled tourism </strong>to get <strong>to know the experience</strong> and see if it can be done without altering local life too much.

The <strong>cooperative they created to manage and foster this fund </strong>(called \"Tosepan Tomin\", \"Everybody's Money\" in Nahuat) <strong>looked for advice and training</strong> <strong>to learn how to manage the project</strong> and soon was able to also <strong>make loans</strong>, which attracted many new communities where the cooperative <strong>opened more and more branches</strong>. As this initiative grew, the banking authorities forced the cooperative to <strong>legally formalize</strong> its operations. Tosepan agreed because, although it was a complicated and time-consuming process, this would give <strong>its members greater certainty</strong> that the money they were investing was in good hands. The savings and loan fund was so successful that by <a href=\"https://www.territorioybienestar.mx/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Libro-Tosepan-COLOR.pdf\">2018</a> it had $405 million pesos in savings, $385 million in loans and more than 36,000 members from 441 communities that <strong>until then didn’t get financial services</strong>. Although other private services are now lending to these populations, many people still prefer Tosepan because <strong>it does not charge them commissions</strong>, <strong>it offers them a higher interest rate</strong> and it has <strong>designed products that adequately respond to their needs and that seek to improve their quality of life and that of their communities</strong>, such as life insurance, remittance payments, and savings funds for children, retirees and festivities. It also offers <strong>credits that can be paid on dates set according to the economic capacity of each person and according to the objectives of the loan</strong> (for instance, the time it takes to harvest a given crop). Some of the loans are intended for production, for women, for emergencies, for health, or to build or rehabilitate houses. On rare occasions the cooperative seeks external financing to be able to offer loans such as the housing ones, but in reality its <strong>savings fund model </strong>has worked because of two main strategies: The first is <strong>to operate mainly with the members' savings, that is, with money from the communities themselves</strong> (members contribute at least $600 pesos to be able to join and use the cooperative's services and if they decide to leave they get their money back). The second strategy is <strong>to bet on trust</strong>, since the cooperative provides loans to people who other financial institutions reject because they lack economic backing. To guarantee repayment, the cooperative makes use of what they call a <strong>\"solidarity credit\" methodology</strong>: people who apply for a loan first have to ask permission from their <strong>community</strong>, and if the community <strong>approves and endorses</strong> them (because they know them personally and know their history), then the cooperative passes their application on to a credit committee for loan approval. If the person fails to repay, the cooperative may ask the community to <strong>talk to them and help them solve their problem, or to back them up by paying on their behalf</strong> to preserve the chance of getting future support. Such a situation will be avoided at all costs by the borrower so as to avoid getting in trouble with their community.</p>\n<p> </p>"

Also, the cooperative <strong>trained a group of health promoters</strong> who have the task of approaching the communities, organizing hygiene campaigns and health days, giving workshops and making home visits, all with the intent of <strong>preventing</strong> illness rather than only treating it.

In any case, The Refuge is careful <strong>not to depend wholly on these platforms</strong> to get customers because this same evaluation system that serves well to promote, also has flaws that can be detrimental: if, for some reason, there is a disagreement with a visitor, for instance, the platforms are not able to judge who is right, the negative comments are never removed and when they are recorded they have the potential to have a long-term effect, even after the problem has been solved.

In addition, there is a <strong>certain reluctance to support projects that are not considered feasible or are not seen as a priority</strong>, and there is <strong>distrust</strong> in the use that some organizations and donors make of funds (either because of their capacity to manage them or because of previous experiences of corruption).</p>\n<p>In an attempt to address this, the government has created mechanisms to formalize social organizations themselves, as well as the processes for providing them with support. One such mechanism is the <strong>certification of organizations as authorized donors</strong>, which seeks to <strong>make investment in social projects more effective and make it easier</strong> for civil organizations to get financial support. But <strong>getting this certification is, itself, not easy</strong>: the procedure is very complex, time-consuming and tedious and, in addition, <a href=\"http://www.diputados.gob.mx/LeyesBiblio/regley/Reg_LISR_060516.pdf\"><strong>it requires compliance with certain requirements that are not available to all projects</strong></a>, such as being formally registered or contributing to solving problems that are in line with the State’s development agenda.</p>\n<p>This and other <strong>norms for regularizing and granting support</strong> to civil society organizations demand <strong>standardized requirements, which place organizations in conditions of inequality</strong> because they favor initiatives with a higher degree of:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Structuring</strong>.

Given that in this city the inhabitants of certain areas have access to an average of 6m<sup>2</sup> of green areas per person, while others have access to approx. 40m<sup>2</sup>, the MACIA Studio team decided to use a version of the technique known as <strong>participatory mapping</strong> that uses graphic representations (maps, drawings, models) <strong>to make it easier for the beneficiaries to see the project ideas more clearly and share their points of view</strong>: In a park, they drew squares of various sizes, one inside the other, with yarn.

After telling the children about the <strong>inequality</strong> in the distribution of green areas in their city, they were invited to stand on the large square, where they were told to imagine standing on the area with the most access to green space. Next, they were asked to enter the 24m<sup>2</sup> square, and so successively the children were placed inside the squares until they reached the smallest one.

To<strong> assess </strong>this, ASRI takes into account the community’s proximity to the National Park and other <strong>indicators that it designed in collaboration with Park staff and with the communities themselves</strong> (such as whether they have left entrances for loggers, if there are traces of deforestation, etc.). On the basis of these indicators, <strong>each community is assigned a color that corresponds to a specific discount.</strong> The blue color, for example, gives a 50% discount to the communities that live far from the Park and have no deforestation indicators, while the green color gives a 70% discount to those that do not have deforestation indicators either, but live near the National Park. Many communities know that they cannot get the highest discount, because it is impossible for them to fully stop exploiting the forest’s resources, or to completely abandon their agricultural activities to comply a 100% with the indicators. And yet, this system has helped to significantly reduce logging in the region because, since <strong>the colors and their discounts are assigned to entire communities and not to each person</strong>, people who continue logging are pressured by their neighbors to stop doing so.</p>\n<p> </p>"

In the summer of 2023, artists Chen Jianing (陈嘉宁) and Bai Haiyang (柏海洋) used that space as a base to engage deeply with various people from the neighborhood. Jianing, for instance, had a brilliant idea <strong>to connect with the locals and make them feel comfortable</strong>: instead of renting an apartment in the neighborhood to live and sleep during his artistic stay, he set up a small room inside the mini exhibition space. To furnish it, he asked his parents to send traditional <strong>food from his hometown (in Guangdong) that he offered to neighbors </strong>who stopped by the exhibition space <strong>in exchange for furniture</strong> they no longer used or could lend him. This gave him an excuse to chat with them, get to know their homes, etc. Upon learning that despite being a very old neighborhood, part of it would soon be demolished due to new development plans in the area, Jianing and Haiyang decided to capture the essence of their community before it disappeared with the changes. Haiyang did this by collecting very symbolic and interesting belongings from the neighbors (diaries, keys, tickets, photos, etc.) and putting together an exhibition with them. And Chen Jianing created a <a href=\"https://www.sohu.com/a/683423689_756151\">beautiful book</a> with stories and photographs of the local night market and its characters.</p>"

The conservation and management of its natural resources have not been well <strong>balanced </strong>with the economic needs of the country and its inhabitants. Over the years, the Mexican government has taken some measures to redress this problem by enabling the communities that live in natural areas to<strong> benefit economically from their lands without overexploiting forest resources</strong> and destroying the habitat of endangered species. Natural Protected Areas (NPAs), for instance, are a mechanism for landowners to manage nature in a more sustainable manner: agriculture and cattle farming are prohibited in the most vulnerable areas (the core NPA zones), but in the “less vulnerable” areas (the buffer zones), land-owning communities are <strong>granted</strong> <strong>permits</strong> to make a <strong>moderate and controlled use of resources</strong>, which is defined and monitored by means of environmental management plans. However, <strong>forests offer very important environmental services to alleviate the devastating effects of climate change</strong> (they capture water and CO2 emissions, for instance, and provide shelter to plants, animals and entire ecosystems), and <strong>these modest mechanisms are proving insufficient to protect them</strong>. <strong>Finding alternatives</strong> that further limit their use but still allow communities to sustainably live off the land <strong>remains a challenge</strong>.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<h4><span>How can rainforests be effectively protected when landowning communities depend on their resources for survival?</span></h4>\n<p>\n</p>",

The group realized that many of the <strong>region’s small-scale landowners live off payments from logging companies that buy their exploitation permits</strong> –issued by the government under the NPA model– or even <strong>buy their land itself to log it</strong>. As these environmentalists saw it, the land exploitation permits were not really helping the <strong>urgent</strong> task of forest conservation. But how to convince the communities to stop using their lands or selling their permits when they rely on this for their livelihood? So the group came up with what was then a very novel strategy: they would <strong>offer financial compensation to the communities in exchange for them to relinquish their rights of exploitation and commit to keeping their lands intact</strong>. This sum of money would have to be <strong>at least equivalent</strong> to what the landowners would otherwise make from using the permits themselves or from selling them to the logging companies. The exchange would enable both the community’s survival and the forests’ conservation. And, in order <strong>to raise the necessary funding</strong> to meet these payments, the environmentalists <strong>formed the civil association</strong> <strong>Friends of Calakmul</strong> (<a href=\"http://www.calakmul.org\"><strong>Amigos de Calakmul</strong></a>).</p>\n<p> </p>"

The carbon credits market is one of the recognized international mechanisms that <strong>incentivize</strong> different people and institutions to voluntarily <strong>reduce their environmental footprint and take responsibility</strong> for the problem of climate change: if a company produces emissions, it can “offset” them by buying CERs from people or institutions who effectively reduce emissions through a reforestation program, for instance, or through a renewable energy program. To partake in the market, Friends of Calakmul has <strong>partnered</strong> with Terra Global Capital, a consulting organization from the United States that specializes in acting as an intermediary and which <strong>helps by finding companies that emit greenhouse gases</strong> <strong>and are interested in buying carbon credits</strong> on the international market to offset them.  As the <strong>Calakmul communities neutralize emissions</strong> by maintaining the environmental services of the rainforest, <strong>they can get CERs and then sell them</strong> to these companies.</p>\n<p> </p>"

As part of this, Zhejiang province launched a <a href=\"http://www.news.cn/2023-06/25/c_1129714493.htm\"><strong>program</strong> to <strong>revitalize 10,000 of its villages and use 1,000 of them as models to pilot ideas</strong></a> for achieving that transformation (a strategy commonly used in China: testing out ideas or policy proposals in specific communities, and if they work, scaling them to other regions).</p>\n<p>To successfully coordinate this ambitious project, the province didn’t just <strong>assemble a multi-sectoral task force</strong> consisting of significant government ministries (Ecology, Justice, Education, Statistics, Energy, Finance, Human Resources, Food and Materials, Natural Resources, the Women’s Federation, etc.). It has also been <strong>coordinating the efforts</strong> between Party members, authorities at all levels, and representatives from the participating villages.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>The residents of <strong>Yu, one of the villages selected for these pilot ‘experiments,</strong>‘ began having <strong>extensive discussions</strong> on how to meet the mandate of creating a new, more sustainable development model.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<h4></h4>\n<h4><span><strong>How to create a new economy that thrives without destroying our region?</strong></span></h4>\n<p>\n</p>",
        "short_description": "Yu is recognized in China as <strong>a model village for the nationwide sustainable rural development project</strong>. By coming together as a community, clearly defining its priorities, and crafting long-term plans, the village has dramatically shifted its development model to restore the natural landscape of its region and <strong>build a more eco-friendly economy</strong>. It has achieved this mainly by <strong>betting on rural tourism, collaborating with entrepreneurs, and selling agricultural products</strong> such as tea and bamboo.",

How will so much money be paid? What will happen if people, having their lives solved, no longer want to work? etc. By exploring experiences, Lab2050 has <strong>found several arguments to promote its proposal</strong> to implement Universal Basic Income in Korea, such as: a) That selecting beneficiaries and administering aid currently given to vulnerable groups - such as student scholarships, support for the unemployed, etc. - is expensive, time-consuming, prone to corruption, and sometimes so complex that it does not benefit those who need it most. Therefore, creating an alternative system that<strong> uses these same resources to support the entire population instead of specific groups could be more efficient and cheaper.</strong> b) That the budget to finance it could also be obtained by <strong>establishing special taxes</strong> that help achieve other important objectives for the country - such as taxing polluting companies to encourage them to improve their practices, for example. c) That people would hardly want to stop working just because they receive the Universal Basic Income, because the amount they would receive would only serve to survive and, above all, to have a <strong>minimal economic security</strong> to make decisions in their life with more <strong>freedom</strong> and not just out of necessity - because it is a constant, stable, and secure income. d) That it can help <strong>resist and overcome social or economic crises</strong> - Unconditional support that several countries gave to their entire population during the Covid-19 pandemic not only allowed many families to survive but also helped keep the economy active, with money circulating, etc.</li>\n</ol>"

While 164 countries have signed<strong> treaties like the <a href=\"https://disarmament.unoda.org/anti-personnel-landmines-convention/\">Ottawa Convention</a></strong> to stop the use of landmines, major powers like the United States, China, and India have not. Why? Some countries argue that mines are necessary for border defense or to protect strategic zones in the event of armed conflicts. But money is also a factor: these countries still produce, store, or sell landmines, which remains a <strong><a href=\"https://www.infobae.com/america/agencias/2024/11/20/eeuu-no-esta-entre-los-firmantes-del-tratado-de-otawa-contra-las-minas-antipersona/?utm_source=chatgpt.com\">profitable business</a></strong>. This makes it extremely difficult for the world to work together to eliminate this danger.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>In <strong>Cambodia</strong> alone, during the Vietnam War, the <strong>U.S. dropped more than 26 million explosive submunitions</strong>, and these, along with landmines and other explosives placed by all the warring groups over three decades of conflict, have made the country one of the most dangerous places in the world for its people.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>So <strong>even though the war ended in the ’90s, the impact is still devastating</strong>. It affects the country’s economy, which largely depends on rice cultivation and needs those territories. And it particularly impacts rural communities. In provinces like Preah Vihear, where 65% of the population lives in extreme poverty and depends on agriculture to survive, <strong>people have no choice but to risk using these mine-contaminated lands to grow crops</strong>.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Since 1979, over 64,000 people have been <strong>victims</strong> of these explosives, leaving Cambodia with more than 29,000 deaths and the highest per capita proportion of <strong>amputees</strong> in the world.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Although the <strong>Cambodian government</strong> has been reluctant to sign the Cluster Munitions Convention because it fears vulnerability against neighboring countries, it did sign the Ottawa Treaty and<strong> committed to clearing all landmines in its territory <a href=\"https://ihl-databases.icrc.org/en/ihl-treaties/apmbc/article-5\">by 2025</a></strong>.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>That’s why, since the ’90s, with help from various international organizations and foreign governments, Cambodia has cleared over 2 million explosives and cleaned more than 1 billion square meters of land.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>However, the work is slow and expensive, and in 2023, the country reported that it <strong><a href=\"https://www.the-monitor.org/reports/landmine-monitor\">suspected 435 km² of its territory</a> might still be contaminated </strong>with landmines, unexploded ordnance (UXO), or other remnants of war (ERW).</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<h4><span><strong>How can we help speed up the cleanup process, make it safer, </strong></span><span><strong>more affordable, and more efficient?</strong></span></h4>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>",

One day, while looking into the devastating problem of landmines in Africa, Bart remembered an article about rodents trained to detect explosives in labs. <strong>The connection was instant: </strong>if rats could smell explosives, why not use them to clear minefields?</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Bart <strong>sought the support</strong> of Ron Verhagen, a professor from the University of Antwerp who was<strong> an expert</strong> on rats.

With limited funding, Bart <strong>set up a small training center</strong> in Tanzania, strategically chosen because:</p>\n<p> </p>\n<ul>\n<li>It’s the natural habitat of the African giant rats.</li>\n<li>Sokoine Agricultural University provided technical support and land to build APOPO’s training headquarters.</li>\n<li>The climate was similar to other mined areas, allowing better testing.</li>\n</ul>\n<p> </p>\n<p>There, the rats learned the basics: smell TNT, scratch the ground, and get a reward—a piece of banana! Challenges arose: some rats preferred napping to working, while others got distracted by new smells. But over time, the team <strong>perfected the method until it worked</strong> in controlled conditions. However, the real challenge lay outside, in the minefields where theory meets reality.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>In 2003, <strong>armed with data and trained rats</strong>, Bart <strong>presented a risky proposal to the Mozambican government</strong>: “Let me show you that these rats can find mines without dying in the process, and at a fraction of the cost.” The challenge was enormous: mines buried for over 20 years, land compacted by intense sun, and war debris everywhere…</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>But the HeroRATs succeeded:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>They found <strong>all</strong> the mines in the test zones.</li>\n<li><strong>Ignored</strong> 99% of the <strong>scrap</strong> <strong>metal</strong> that confuses metal detectors.</li>\n<li>Worked<strong> much faster</strong> than conventional methods—while a human team with metal detectors can take up to 4 days to scan 400 square meters of mined land (especially in areas filled with war scrap that causes false alarms), a single HeroRAT can <strong>cover the same area in just 20 minutes</strong>. The secret? These rats are <strong>trained to ignore metal and focus solely on the smell of explosives</strong>.</li>\n</ul>\n<p> </p>"

Mine Action Program</strong></span></p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Since APOPO’s arrival in Cambodia in 2014, <strong>it hasn’t operated in isolation but as a strategic ally </strong>to the Cambodian government and other national and international organizations dedicated to mine clearance. They <strong>collaborate in a well-structured way: </strong>APOPO operates under the supervision of the Cambodian Mine Action and Victim Assistance Authority (CMAA) and works closely with the Cambodian Mine Action Center (CMAC), the state agency for mine clearance. This strategic trio <strong>divides responsibilities with precision:</strong> the CMAA <strong>sets cleanup priorities</strong> based on population density, agricultural potential, and recent incidents; CMAC <strong>provides personnel and logistical infrastructure </strong>to remove mines and explosives; while <strong>APOPO provides its innovative army of rats and detection dogs, accelerating the process exponentially.</strong></p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Before starting operations, the HeroRATs had to <strong>prove their effectiveness</strong> through rigorous tests under the International Mine Action Standards (IMAS), achieving <strong>100% accuracy, which ultimately convinced the most skeptical authorities. </strong>APOPO <strong>didn’t just replicate its African model in Cambodia</strong>; they trained their rats to detect artisanal mines, especially common in Cambodia, and to work on flood-prone soils, a unique challenge in the region. In fact, their<strong> low-cost technology approach</strong> has been especially valuable: unlike expensive drones or scanners, rats are relatively easy to breed and train locally, <strong>creating employment opportunities</strong> for communities.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong><u>The Landmine Clearance Method</u></strong></p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>APOPO’s land clearance method is brilliant because it<strong> integrates traditional methods</strong> (humans with metal detectors) <strong>with animal innovation</strong>:</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>The <strong>operation starts with the HeroDOGs</strong>, primarily Belgian Shepherds that have been part of APOPO’s program since 2017 when the organization <strong>established its Canine Training Center</strong> in Kampong Chhnang—the first specialized center for technical inspection dogs (TSD) in Southeast Asia. These <strong>dogs play a crucial role in precisely delineating the boundaries of mined areas</strong>.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Once the area is marked, the <strong>HeroRATs</strong> take over. Equipped with harnesses and guided by two humans, these extraordinary rats methodically scan every inch of the marked dangerous area. When they detect TNT, they stop and scratch the ground. This <strong>advantage is key in Cambodia, where conventional metal detectors are constantly fooled by the metal debris </strong>left by decades of war (bullets, bomb fragments, and other military scraps). The rats, however, <strong>ignore all metal and only detect the smell of explosives</strong>.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>In the final phase,<strong> human teams from CMAC verify each signal marked by the rats</strong> and safely remove the explosives. <strong>Specialized machines</strong> clear the vegetation for the next day and manual deminers create safe paths for the work teams.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>The result of this integrated system is overwhelming: a process that’s <strong>not only safer, but very fast and cost-effective!</strong></p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong><u>The Rigorous Training of HeroRATs and HeroDOGs</u></strong></p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>The <strong>process</strong> <strong>of turning African giant rats into expert landmine detectors </strong>is as meticulous as it is fascinating. It all begins when the young rats are just four weeks old: first, they undergo a period of socialization, where they get used to human contact and different environments. By the time they reach ten weeks, they start their training with the \"click-reward\" method: they learn that when they smell TNT and hear a click, they will receive a treat (banana-avocado smoothie). The training intensifies in progressive stages, from recognizing the scent on a small table to searching for real landmines buried in APOPO’s training minefield. To graduate, each rat must find all the mines in a 400 m² area with no more than one mistake,<strong> demonstrating 100% accuracy under international standards</strong>. What's amazing is that, despite their size, these rats cannot set off the mines:<strong> their weight (a maximum of 1.5 kg) is not enough to trigger explosions</strong>, making them perfect allies for this dangerous work. Each HeroRAT works for about 4-5 years before retiring to a well-deserved \"retirement\" with continued care.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>In the case of HeroDOGs, the training combines discipline and play. These Belgian Malinois, selected for their exceptional sense of smell and stamina, begin their training as puppies at the Kampong Chhnang center. The first thing they learn is to associate the scent of explosives with their favorite Kong toy. Gradually, the training becomes more complex: they must search in straight lines, signal explosives without touching them, simply sitting 1 meter before the detected item and pointing their nose at it.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>The most difficult test comes in training fields, where dogs show that they can work among rusted bullets, old cans, and other war remnants without getting distracted. A <strong>certified</strong> HeroDOG can inspect up to 1,500 square meters in a single day—equivalent to four football fields—with flawless precision. And like the rats, these dogs enjoy a dignified retirement after 5-6 years of service, spending their last years playing and receiving care from their handlers.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>Together, HeroRATs and HeroDOGs form a perfect team</strong> <strong>that complements each other to make human and machine efforts more efficient</strong>: while rats are unbeatable in open terrain, dogs conquer dense vegetation areas where rats can't operate.</p>\n<p> </p>"

Each country faces its own challenges, but the organization has adapted without losing its essence. Their success relies on <strong>two key strategies: generating trust through scientific evidence and adapting to local realities</strong>.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>It’s crucial for APOPO to <strong>generate scientific trust</strong> because governments wouldn’t allow them to work in their countries without clear proof that their methods really work. Demining is costly and dangerous, so governments need to be sure that APOPO's methods are effective before letting them work. That's why the organization not only works in the field but also <strong>documents everything</strong> they do, including errors and improvements. They <strong>publish research </strong>and detailed reports on their tests to ensure their methods are reliable and trusted. Furthermore, part of their strategy is to <strong>meet all international safety and efficacy standards</strong>, which allows them not only to work with governments but also to advise and help others replicate their methods in different contexts. For example, in Mozambique, they had to <strong>demonstrate</strong> for four years that their rats detected 100% of the mines in test areas before being granted permission to continue working. This <strong>scientific</strong> <strong>transparency</strong>, along with compliance with international standards, helps <strong>gain the trust </strong>of authorities and local communities, and encourages <strong>others to follow the same path</strong> to apply these methods successfully in other regions.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>At the same time, APOPO <strong>adapts to the conditions of each country to remain effective</strong>. In each place, they adjust their approach according to the needs of the terrain and the culture. In Ukraine, for instance, due to extreme cold, they use dogs instead of rats for mine detection. In Cambodia, they trained rats to detect plastic mines, which are more common in that country. In Senegal, they've focused more on agricultural land, as requested by local communities. Additionally, in each country, they<strong> train local teams</strong>, which not only facilitates learning but also <b>ensures the long-term sustainability of operations</b>.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong><u>A Commitment to Research and Development</u></strong></p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>To expand their impact not only in other regions but also in other areas, APOPO<strong>’s research and development center</strong> in Tanzania has the goal of<strong> training animals for new applications</strong>. One of their most significant achievements has been training rats to detect <strong>tuberculosis</strong> in heat-inactivated human sputum samples. This breakthrough is now being used in several African countries, such as Tanzania and Ethiopia, where rats help detect the disease in regions with limited resources to perform fast tests. Thanks to this animal-based technology, APOPO has<strong> helped detect over 32,000 tuberculosis cases that might otherwise have gone unnoticed. </strong>The rats are trained to identify suspect samples, which are then <strong>verified by humans </strong>to confirm the results. This method has already <strong>proven effective and promises to improve early detection of tuberculosis in countries with limited healthcare systems</strong>.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Currently, APOPO is <strong>exploring other innovative applications for their rats</strong>. Among these, <strong>rescue and search operations </strong>stand out, where rats could play a crucial role in <strong>natural disasters</strong>. Thanks to their compact size, agility, and exceptional sense of smell, the trained rats <strong>could overcome the limitations of current technologies </strong>in rescue operations, such as penetrating rubble, navigating difficult terrain, and locating survivors in real-time. Equipped with technology such as chips that allow humans to track their location and miniature cameras that transmit what they are seeing, the rats could revolutionize how searches for<strong> trapped people</strong> are conducted.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>APOPO is also exploring the use of rats <strong>to detect soil contaminants or ecological irregularities</strong>, by identifing levels of petroleum hydrocarbons in contaminated soils, which is crucial for environmental remediation.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>In addition, APOPO is venturing into<strong> detecting wildlife smuggling</strong> by training rats to detect products from endangered species, such as pangolin scales and elephant ivory. Using real containers and specialized equipment, the rats are<strong> trained to inspect these containers using their sense of smell without opening them</strong>, making the <strong>detection of smuggling</strong> more efficient and less invasive than traditional methods. Operational trials are currently being conducted at key ports to assess their effectiveness in real-world conditions.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Admirably, <strong>to offset the carbon emissions of all of these activities</strong>, APOPO launched HeroTREEs, a program by which it is promoting Syntropic Agroforestry as a highly effective method, partnering with community-based organizations to establish demonstration plots and provide hands-on training. Through sustainable, organic farming practices in the Uluguru Mountains, farmers improve soil and water quality, boost food security, reduce poverty, and protect biodiversity.</p>\n<p> </p>"

It’s <strong>not just about educating children but improving everyone’s life</strong> <strong>through projects that directly involve them</strong>.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<ul>\n<li>They <strong>opened a Learning Center for All:</strong> The SDG Community Center is a space where the elders can participate in social and recreational activities to stay active and connected with the community.

With the support of monks, they are<strong> teaching elderly people from various communities how to grow vegetables using modern farming techniques</strong>. The idea is to help them improve their nutrition, generate income by selling their products at local markets, and, most importantly, prevent isolation by keeping them active and involved in the community. Students help with tasks like installing the gardens and water tanks. Within this project, elderly people are also <strong>taught how to use raised beds, specifically designed so they can work </strong>without bending over, making it easier for them to grow their own food and generate extra income. These raised beds require less space and are ideal for growing simple and profitable crops.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p> </p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Agriculture adapted for people with disabilities:</strong> Some <strong>students designed semi-raised beds</strong> that people with disabilities <strong>can reach from their wheelchairs</strong>, enabling them to have their own home gardens and generate income independently.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p> </p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Food delivery by drones:</strong> During the pandemic, the school delivered food to the elderly and healthcare workers using drones!

After independence in 1948, the new Myanmar government, dominated by the Bamar ethnic majority, made agreements with several minorities, such as the Karen, Shan, and Kachin, to give them more autonomy, allow them to self-govern, and control their resources. Unfortunately, many of these promises were not fulfilled, leading to uprisings and violent conflicts in some regions. To make matters worse, in 1962, the military took power in a coup, and under the new military junta, the country’s control was even more centralized. This triggered a series of clashes between the government and <strong>different ethnic groups, which in 1988 joined forces with students, monks, and activists to demand more democracy in a movement that was brutally attacked by the military junta</strong>, leaving thousands dead and forcing many to flee to neighboring countries.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>Among them was Cynthia Maung, a Karen ethnic doctor</strong> who, while escaping, witnessed the difficult situation of refugees, students, and pro-democracy activists who had settled on one side or another of the Thai border.

Well,<strong> from several fronts at once:</strong></p>\n<p> </p>\n<ul>\n<li>On one hand, by <strong>educating patients</strong>: The clinic not only treats them and provides instructions on how to take care of themselves but also ensures that they truly understand their condition and treatment. Why? Because many of them, <strong>when they return home, will share what they’ve learned </strong>with their families and communities, <strong>multiplying</strong> the impact of knowledge. Additionally, this helps with <strong>prevention</strong> and lays the groundwork for healthier communities in the <strong>long term</strong>: when people know how to care for their health, they can prevent their conditions from worsening or even from emerging.

They do this in two ways: first, by <strong>training health workers</strong> who operate in rural clinics where access to doctors is almost nonexistent.

Child Protection and Education</strong></p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>War not only leaves physical wounds, but it also breaks families and leaves many children in extremely vulnerable situations. In the case of Myanmar, thousands of minors have lost their parents, been abandoned, or simply cannot live with their families due to poverty, violence, or displacement. For these children, Mae Tao Clinic<strong> not only provides medical care but also a safe place to grow, learn, and dream</strong> of a better future.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>The clinic's child protection program actually began as a <strong>practical response to an immediate need of its staff:</strong> in 1995, doctors and workers at the clinic, who had nowhere to leave their children while treating patients, <strong>decided to create a small daycare to take care of them</strong>. But of course, their work with refugees made them realize that many other children also needed help. Children whose mothers had died during childbirth or who had been abandoned because poverty prevented their families from caring for them, for example. That’s how, little by little, they <strong>began to admit more children</strong> with these situations, expanding the daycare into a larger program.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong><u>From a Daycare to a Comprehensive School</u></strong></p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>As the <strong>children grew, so did the program</strong>. In 1997, for example, they <strong>created the Child Development Center (CDC), a small primary school</strong> with only five teachers. And in 2005, they opened the secondary school so students could continue their education. By 2009, the CDC had its first graduating class of 12th grade, and that same year, a new building was opened to house all the students, from primary to secondary school, in one place.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Today, at the CDC, students can obtain<strong> internationally recognized certifications</strong>, such as the GED (equivalent to a high school diploma in the United States). This allows them to apply to universities, get better-paid jobs, and in some cases, even obtain scholarships to study abroad.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong><u>A Safe Refuge for the Most Vulnerable</u></strong></p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Another need identified by the clinic was to offer <strong>safe shelters</strong> for abandoned or orphaned children, or, for example, for those who could not live with their families because their parents worked in precarious conditions that didn’t allow them to care for them. Many of these <strong>minors</strong> were living through very hard situations and needed help.

This meticulous process paid off in 2008 with the creation of the Infection Prevention Unit (IPU), which <strong>established standardized procedures</strong> for the entire clinic. But they didn’t stop there: a decade later, in 2018, they <strong>built a dedicated physical space exclusively for this work</strong>, designed specifically to optimize the flow of materials from their entry (in contaminated state) to their exit (completely sterilized).

Many kinds of charitable deeds are encouraged in Islam.

In Indonesia, where there is a lot of poverty to fight, many Muslims (who represent about 90% of the population) usually give their donations to social organizations or programs that have been designed by the government to channel them to the people most in need, but the creators of Dompet Dhuafa realized that many people were losing the will to make these donations due to the lack of transparency with which they were handled as well as the lack of results.

In models coupled to the OriHime-D (the mobile robot), you can even take the robot to the desired place (a living room, a restaurant) and control its movement remotely — and thus “visit” places in real time or “attend” events, family gatherings, weddings!</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Kentaro’s <strong>true innovation</strong> was not only technical, but <strong>one of perspective. </strong>He didn’t just want to <b>live his life working</b>, practicing one of the common professions. <strong>He wanted to devote himself to building a bridge</strong> so that those trapped by illness, distance, or disability would not only observe the world, but could live in it: work, converse, celebrate, <strong>create memories</strong>, connect and communicate with others, interact, move autonomously, communicate emotions, take on different roles, feel useful and relevant among them, and, very importantly,<strong> find new paths for their lives by meeting new people</strong>, collaborating with others, generating income, and hearing new ideas.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>That’s why, as Kentaro himself says, <strong>he invented his own profession: that of robot communicator! </strong>And to perfect it, he<strong> ran several experiments to better understand how human communication works</strong>: Despite considering himself very antisocial, for example, at university he <strong>moved into the campus dorms </strong>to be able to interact more with his classmates. He later <strong>worked as a camp leader </strong>at children’s camps, where he learned to work as a team and to speak in public convincingly. Later he<strong> approached a </strong><b>pantomime club</b>, and the staff and patients of the Japanese ALS Association, with whom he understood that beyond words, communication requires gestures, physical presence, and spontaneity. Thanks to all those efforts, today every detail of his robots — from the angle of their head tilt to their numerous pre-programmed movements — is designed to <strong>replicate natural interactions</strong>.</p>\n<p> </p>"

Or those who want to spend time with family who live very far away. Or students who cannot attend classes when they are ill. Or people with physical disabilities…</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong><u>By creating a platform to train them and showcasing them: A Café staffed by </u></strong><strong><u>robots!</u></strong></p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Ory Lab needed<strong> a space where it could test and improve </strong>the avatar robots, <strong>showcasing</strong> them to the public in real life. And <strong>the pilots (the people who operate them) </strong>needed a place<strong> to learn how to use them and receive honest feedback</strong>. That is, it wasn’t enough for them to exist in laboratories; a space was needed where they could function in an everyday environment.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>And so, the Ory Lab team came up with a practical solution: <strong>to open a Café </strong>where people in isolation could work alongside a conventional staff of waiters, cooks, etc., operating the robots remotely! But<strong> not as a controlled experiment, rather as a real business</strong>, where in addition to <strong>opening job opportunities for them</strong>, each cup of coffee served would <strong>test</strong> both the technology and their ability to integrate into the labor world using the robots.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>In 2018, they decided to<strong> test the idea</strong> by opening a small <strong>pilot</strong> Café in the city of Tokyo, to explore what it was like to work with robots, what was needed, whether it worked, how it felt.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>To <strong>attract</strong> people in conditions of isolation willing to participate as pilots for the robots, they made<strong> a call through social networks</strong>, as they knew it is the place that most of them use to socialize and communicate with the world. And of course, the response was great! Ten people quickly came forward to take part in this adventure.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>The first days were a constant <strong>learning process</strong> for everyone. The pilots, from their homes or hospitals, discovered how to overcome their nerves and move through a physical space via their robotic avatars, while the on-site café team — waiters, baristas, and cooks — learned to work with their robot coworkers. The customers who arrived, attracted by the novelty, unknowingly became a fundamental part of the <strong>experiment</strong>, giving spontaneous <strong>feedback</strong> with their reactions and comments.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Ory Lab ran <strong>3 pilot Café experiments before opening the current one</strong>. In each, they <strong>addressed the challenges as they encountered them</strong>. When they noticed, for example, that it took the robots a long time to move between tables and that this made customers bored from waiting so long, they tried calling more pilots and <strong>exploring other possible workflows</strong>. In the end they decided to <strong>divide tasks</strong> among robots: some would focus on transporting food to tables, and others on chatting with customers to take their orders and entertain them while their food arrived, etc. This distribution wasn’t in the original plan — it arose from <strong>observing what worked</strong> during actual service.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>After those first attempts, they had to pause testing for a while due to the pandemic, but in 2021 they started a new pilot with a coffeeshop called <strong>Avatar Robot Café DAWN ver.β </strong>(<a href=\"https://dawn2021.orylab.com/en/\"><strong>分身ロボットカフェ DAWN ver.β</strong></a>), which is the current one.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>To help promote that people living in isolation have <strong>more and better conditions </strong>to be able to socialize in the world outside their homes, Ory Lab<strong> took every measure they could think of so that the Café itself would be as accessible as possible for everyone</strong>: it doesn’t have a single step, the space is designed so that wheelchairs can move easily, each table has outlets for medical equipment, and the bathrooms have care beds. In addition, the <strong>menu has options for those who have difficulty</strong> eating, and special cutlery or food grinding equipment is loaned to those who need it. In other words, every element of the café — from the height of the tables to the texture of the floors — was <strong>designed so that no one has to ask for “special accommodations,” because everything, from the outset, is made for everyone.</strong></p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong><u>By scaling their project</u></strong></p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Ory Lab has done so well with its project that today it is exploring different ways<strong> to scale it slowly but decisively</strong>:</p>\n<p> </p>\n<ul>\n<li>It has, for example, <strong>increased the number of pilots</strong>. Today, 30 conventional employees work alongside 100 remote pilots! The pilots work on an <strong>outsourcing basis with flexible schedules </strong>that adapt to their needs: some connect a few hours a day, others on certain days of the week,<strong> rotating according to their capacities</strong>. Some pilots even operate different robots in different shifts.</li>\n</ul>\n<p> </p>\n<ul>\n<li>It uses the Café as a <strong>laboratory to experiment </strong>with its robots, improve them, and continue developing new ones. When they learned, for example, that Mika and Sae (two of their pilots with ALS) had been baristas, they <strong>took advantage of their enormous experience </strong>and set out to create a <strong>barista robot</strong> in <strong>collaboration</strong> with Kawada Industries. Now they prepare coffee from home — grinding beans, adjusting the machine, and even making latte art… all through their robotic avatar!</li>\n</ul>\n<p> </p>\n<ul>\n<li>Despite the success their Café has had, Ory Lab is not really considering the option of scaling its project by opening new cafés by itself or selling franchises to an investor. First, because their <strong>team feels they still have a lot to experiment with to improve</strong> the robots and expand the opportunities for them to be adopted in different contexts. But also, because setting up such a café costs a fortune and needs a lot of support. That’s why their current<strong> bet is to collaborate with governments</strong>, as they are doing with Denmark, where they have already opened their <strong>second Avatar Robot Café</strong>, with pilots from Tokyo helping, thanks to the<strong> automatic translator</strong> built into the robots.</li>\n</ul>\n<p> </p>\n<ul>\n<li>And not only that! Ory Lab is already organizing <a href=\"https://dawn2021.orylab.com/en/guide_tour/\"><strong>tourist walks with robots as guides</strong></a>. At the Café in Tokyo, people can rent a backpack with an OriHime robot integrated at shoulder height that, operated by one of the pilots from home or hospital, tells stories and fun facts about the nearby neighborhoods while you walk. The tours last 1.5 hours and for now are a <strong>project in an experimental phase.</strong></li>\n</ul>\n<p> </p>"

Everything — from how they devised a response to the problem of loneliness, how they managed to put it into practice, how they are making their way — is a long story very, very worth getting to know in more depth. It is a space full of energy, where every day there is innovation, adjustments to details, and a search for ways to make these avatars connect people better.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>But we want to close this post with <strong>some principles on innovation that Kentaro discovered</strong> along the way, which he wrote in his <strong>autobiography</strong>, and which we want to share because of how much <strong>we can all learn from them for our own projects:</strong></p>\n<p> </p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Invest in experience and learn by doing (not just theorizing).</strong> When Kentaro realizes he <strong>doesn’t know how to do something he needs, he learns how to do it.</strong> Whether by seeking <strong>someone who can teach </strong>him, taking a <strong>course</strong>, looking for <strong>YouTube tutorials</strong>, or buying some similar commercial model to do <strong>reverse engineering</strong> —which is when you take apart something that already exists to learn its parts, understand how it works, and thus be able to improve it or reinvent it with a new purpose.</li>\n</ul>\n<p> </p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Listen to and observe reactions.</strong> Users don’t always know what they need… but their <strong>reactions don’t lie</strong>. Instead of only asking them what they want with a survey, Kentaro tries to visit them and observe how they interact with the robots in the café or in hospitals. A gesture of frustration or a spontaneous smile tells him more than any survey.</li>\n</ul>\n<p> </p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>If you wait for the perfect moment, you’ll never start.</strong> Kentaro has <strong>never waited to know everything before starting</strong>. Many of the improvements to the avatars arise because, when he has a <strong>new idea</strong>, he doesn’t let time pass and, <strong>taking advantage of it being fresh, thinks about how it will be used, draws</strong> as clear an image as possible of what that thing he wants to make would look like,<strong> makes a prototype immediately</strong> with simple materials,<strong> tests it with users</strong> in the real world, and <strong>adjusts on the fly </strong>with their <strong>feedback</strong>, <strong>learning from mistakes and real needs </strong>as they arise. Perfection is the enemy of the possible.</li>\n</ul>\n<p> </p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Stubbornness is necessary. </strong>When one of his ideas — especially a new one — doesn’t convince others, Kentaro <strong>doesn’t let it die.</strong> He knows that innovating often means working in <strong>solitude</strong>. So he <strong>devotes his free nights to focusing, entering his own world, and turning those abstract concepts into something tangible:</strong> a prototype or <strong>something others can see, touch, and finally understand.</strong> Because one thing is to discuss ideas and quite another is to ignore a robot that greets you with perfect movements right before your eyes. If they don’t understand you, it’s hard for them to support you.</li>\n</ul>\n<p> </p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Finish what matters.</strong> In his early years he jumped from idea to idea. He later learned that to be able to innovate<strong> you have to choose:</strong> Better to <strong>complete</strong> something that works than have ten things half done.</li>\n</ul>\n<p> </p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Emotion drives hard work.</strong> With a goal so complex, Kentaro has never lacked obstacles and has constantly had to face the frustration that, despite enormous efforts, things fail or don’t turn out as he expected. <strong>How has he not given in?</strong> According to him, he has used several strategies to stay motivated and keep going: One is that when he doesn’t know what to do, he <strong>keeps himself busy with other things to clear his mind </strong>— he goes for a walk, sings, whatever. Other times, he doesn’t stop working but focuses on very specific small tasks to, step by step, achieve progress that excites him. In other words: <strong>divide the problem into small steps</strong> (e.g., “today I’ll just fix this motor”). And the other strategy he uses when he feels like throwing in the towel is to <strong>remind himself of the reasons </strong>why he is doing what he is doing, which in his case is<strong> imagining the faces with which the people who will use it are going to react</strong>. That image definitely <strong>motivates</strong> him to continue!</li>\n</ul>\n<p> </p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Patience: the balance between what you like and what you have to do. </strong>For Kentaro, it’s better to <strong>endure a bit</strong> doing what you don’t feel like, if in the end you can devote yourself to what you love. Putting up with boring meetings is worth it when the reward is spending the night perfecting a new gesture of your avatar.</li>\n</ul>\n<p> </p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Do what you believe is right (with responsibility).</strong> For Kentaro, one should trust one’s own judgment when there are grounds for it. Test alternatives that others ignore. And measure risks with the only limit being not harming others. After all, everything we’ve told here began as the idea of a high school student!</li>\n</ul>\n<p> </p>"

The<strong> circus</strong> also serves Health and Happiness to <strong>promote transversality</strong> among its programs, because it encourages people to engage with all project areas using different forms of learning (dancing, singing, talking), and even to express the connections they see between these areas that could be leveraged.
